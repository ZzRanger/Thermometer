# Thermometer

I created a homemade thermometer for the Science Olympiad event Detector Building. I started by researching the best ways to build a thermometer. I settled with the NTC thermistor because it could get quick and accurate temperature readings between 0 -100 degrees Celsius. I created a voltage dividor circuit with the thermistor and the corresponding code, which read the voltage across the thermistor, converted that to resistance, then calculated a temperature using the Steinhart-Hart Equation (SHH). I also made circuit that lights up a certain LED whenever the thermometer is in a certain temperature range, and a calibration file to calibrate the thermometer to a reference thermometer. My partner created the insulation for the thermistor, initally using a 3D tube.
